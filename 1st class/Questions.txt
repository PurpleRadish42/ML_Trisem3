Answers:

1) A dataset is a collection of related data that is organized in a standardized format. These data sets can hold information such as medical records, or insurance records, and is primarily used by developers or academics across the world to meet their own goals.

2) A file format refers to the structure and organization of data within a file. Each file format has it's own specific extension. For example, images have .png or .jpeg. These extensions helps both the computer, and the person identify what is the structure of a file. It also helps in sharing files across different systems easily, as a .pdf file viewed in one system, can easily be transferred and viewed in another.

For plain tabular data, a CSV format is is better, for complex or hierarchical data, JSON or XML is preferred. And if a dataset is linked to a relational database, then a SQL Dump is the best (The content of an SQL dump is a large collection of SQL statements as text).
