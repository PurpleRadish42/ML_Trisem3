    "# Real Estate Valuation Model Report\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Data Overview\n",
    "The dataset used for real estate valuation consists of 414 instances with six predictive features and one target variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **X1**: Transaction date (continuous)\n",
    "- **X2**: House age (years, continuous)\n",
    "- **X3**: Distance to nearest MRT station (meters, continuous)\n",
    "- **X4**: Number of convenience stores (integer)\n",
    "- **X5**: Latitude (degrees, continuous)\n",
    "- **X6**: Longitude (degrees, continuous)\n",
    "- **Y**: House price per unit area (continuous, target variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Missing Values\n",
    "The dataset contains **no missing values**, ensuring data completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Summary Statistics\n",
    "Key insights from summary statistics:\n",
    "- The house price per unit area ranges from **7.6 to 117.5** with a mean of **37.98**.\n",
    "- High standard deviation (**13.61**) indicates price variability.\n",
    "- Strong negative correlation (**-0.75**) between **distance to MRT station** and **house price**.\n",
    "- Positive correlation (**0.60**) between **number of convenience stores** and **house price**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Outlier Detection and Treatment\n",
    "- **Outliers detected in**: Distance to MRT station (37), Latitude (8), Longitude (35), House price (3).\n",
    "- **Handling Method**: Capped at **Interquartile Range (IQR) boundaries**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Skewness and Transformations\n",
    "- **Distance to MRT station** showed high skewness (**1.216**), so a **log transformation** was applied.\n",
    "- Skewness was successfully reduced post-transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6 Feature Scaling\n",
    "- **Standardization** applied to all numerical features.\n",
    "- Prevents features with large numerical values from dominating the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Feature Selection and Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Correlation-Based Feature Selection\n",
    "- Features with **high correlation** to the target variable were retained.\n",
    "- **House age and MRT distance negatively impact house price**, so they are retained.\n",
    "- **Convenience stores, latitude, and longitude positively impact house price**, making them relevant predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Feature Engineering\n",
    "- **Polynomial features** were explored to capture non-linearity in the model.\n",
    "- **Polynomial Regression (degree 3) improved performance**, suggesting a non-linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Model Development and Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Models Tested\n",
    "#### 3.1.1 Multiple Linear Regression (Baseline)\n",
    "- **Train R²**: 0.69\n",
    "- **Test R²**: 0.73\n",
    "- **Test RMSE**: 6.72\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1.2 Ridge Regression\n",
    "- Best **alpha = 1** (determined via cross-validation)\n",
    "- **Test R²**: 0.731\n",
    "- **Test RMSE**: 6.71\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1.3 Lasso Regression\n",
    "- Best **alpha = 0.0001**\n",
    "- **Test R²**: 0.731\n",
    "- **Test RMSE**: 6.72\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1.4 Polynomial Regression (Degree 3)\n",
    "- **Train R²**: 0.82\n",
    "- **Test R²**: 0.79\n",
    "- **Test RMSE**: 5.87\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Best Model Selection\n",
    "- **Polynomial Regression (Degree 3) provided the highest R²** and lowest RMSE.\n",
    "- **Regularization techniques (Ridge, Lasso) provided marginal improvements over MLR**, suggesting minimal overfitting.\n",
    "- The **third-degree polynomial captured non-linear relationships effectively**, making it the best model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Model Evaluation and Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Performance Metrics\n",
    "- **Cross-Validation Mean R²**: 0.669\n",
    "- **Test MSE**: 34.47\n",
    "- **Test RMSE**: 5.87\n",
    "- **Test MAE**: 4.26\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Insights from Model Coefficients\n",
    "- **Latitude and number of convenience stores** positively impact house prices.\n",
    "- **House age and distance to MRT negatively impact prices**.\n",
    "- **Transaction date has a minor positive impact**, indicating slight price appreciation over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Data-Driven Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Key Findings\n",
    "- **Location Matters**: Proximity to MRT stations and commercial infrastructure strongly influences prices.\n",
    "- **Age of the House**: Older houses tend to have lower prices.\n",
    "- **Feature Scaling and Transformation**: Improved model performance and reduced bias.\n",
    "- **Polynomial Regression** effectively captures market trends, outperforming linear models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Business Recommendations\n",
    "- **Real estate investors should prioritize properties near transit hubs** for higher valuations.\n",
    "- **Newer buildings hold better resale value**.\n",
    "- **Commercial establishments (convenience stores, shopping centers) enhance property desirability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Conclusion\n",
    "- **Polynomial Regression (Degree 3) is the best model for real estate valuation**.\n",
    "- **Feature selection and preprocessing played a crucial role** in improving model accuracy.\n",
    "- **Data-driven insights provide valuable guidance for real estate investments**.\n",
    "- **Further improvements**: Exploring ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost) could enhance predictive performance.\n"
